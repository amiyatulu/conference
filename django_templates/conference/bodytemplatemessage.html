In Recent years, genome-wide studies have greatly accelerated the understanding of fundamental principles of genome organization and its regulation. These studies have provided important insights on the regulatory controls: transcription factors, chromatin regulators and signaling pathways that influence the genome architecture, gene activity and the functional state of the cell. The primary goal of this meeting is to bring together molecular and cellular scientists and computational biologists to highlight recent advances in the spatial and temporal properties of chromatin structure and control of transcription networks that imping on cell development and function. The conference will feature the new methods of genome analysis and application of these methodologies to elucidate the molecular mechanism of cell development and function. This conference places a special focus on multidisciplinary and planned to attract not only experimental researchers working in the fields of genomics, epigenetics but also computational biologists.</p>
 
<p>The format of the conference will include  6 oral sessions, one poster session and an open discussion with the experts. Each oral session will include invited speakers as well as speakers selected from submitted abstracts. Abstracts should contain only new and unpublished material.</p>
